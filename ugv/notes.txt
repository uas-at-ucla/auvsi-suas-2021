UGVs and MAVSDK
---------------
UGVs can operate only in MANUAL and MISSION mode.
    - MANUAL mode essentially means with a controller of sorts that someone has on hands.
    - MISSION mode essentially means we give the UGV some coordinates to drive to.
        *** MISSION mode will be the primary mode we will operate the UGV in. ***

"udp://:14540" is the URL to connect to the drone in the simulator.

Maximum distance a waypoint coordinate can be from UGV is 900 meters [m].
